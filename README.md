# Food-Object-Detection-and-Distance-Estimation-Using-YOLOV5-and-Real-Sense-Camera
#Project OverView
The aim of this project is to develop a system for food object detection and distance estimation using the YOLOv5 model in conjunction with a Real Sense camera. The project focuses on addressing the need for efficient and accurate food detection, which has various applications in areas such as inventory management, food quality control, and dietary monitoring. By leveraging the YOLOv5 model, the system will be capable of detecting various food objects in real-time, while the integration with the Real Sense camera will enable accurate estimation of the distance between the camera and the detected food objects.
